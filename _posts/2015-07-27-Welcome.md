Hey everybody!

Here's my first post, and frankly, I didn't want to start with a technical one, but just wanted to introduce myself.

To be concise, here's what you need to know about me. I'm 30, I live near Paris, France and I've been a developer for more than ten years now. I've been working in the GIS field for five years before exploring the web universe.

I'm currently working at [Evaneos](http://www.evaneos.com) and exploring everything there's to know about DDD, CQRS and Event-Sourcing (and there's still plenty to learn about it). And, lucky you, these should be the subjects I'll be talking about here.

So now that presentations have been made, I declare this blog open.

Enjoy!
